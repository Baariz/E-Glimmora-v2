<objective>
Build the editorial homepage with rich parallax scroll storytelling, plus Philosophy and Privacy Charter content pages.

Purpose: The homepage is the first impression for potential UHNI members. It must communicate Elan Glimmora's identity through a cinematic scroll experience -- not a SaaS landing page, but an editorial luxury narrative. Think Hermes annual report, not Stripe. Philosophy and Privacy Charter pages establish trust and brand philosophy for this exclusive audience.

Output: Complete homepage with 5+ parallax scroll sections, philosophy page, privacy charter page -- all with luxury editorial design and scroll animations.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build editorial homepage with parallax scroll story</name>
  <files>
    src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Replace the placeholder homepage with a cinematic editorial scroll experience. This is the most visually important page in the entire application.

    **CRITICAL DESIGN DIRECTION:**
    - Think luxury editorial magazine, NOT tech landing page
    - No feature grids, no pricing tables, no testimonial carousels
    - Long-form narrative scroll with full-viewport sections
    - Typography-driven with generous whitespace
    - Photography references (use gradient/color blocks as placeholders since no real images)
    - Parallax creates depth and dimensionality as user scrolls

    **Page structure (6+ sections, each full-viewport or near-full):**

    1. 'use client' component (scroll hooks required)
    2. Use `useScroll` and `useTransform` from framer-motion for custom parallax effects
    3. Use `useReducedMotion` hook to respect accessibility preferences
    4. Import `ScrollReveal` component for section entrance animations
    5. Import `Parallax` component for depth effects
    6. Import `Link` from next/link for CTAs

    **Section 1 - Hero (100vh):**
    - Full viewport height, centered content
    - Brand name: "Elan Glimmora" in font-serif, text-7xl md:text-8xl lg:text-9xl, text-rose-900, tracking-tight
    - Tagline: "Sovereign Lifestyle Intelligence" in font-sans, text-lg md:text-xl, text-sand-500, tracking-[0.3em], uppercase
    - Subtle scroll indicator at bottom: animated chevron or line (framer-motion, subtle bounce)
    - Background: Pure white with a very subtle radial gradient (sand-50 at edges)
    - The hero text should have parallax -- move upward and fade as user scrolls down
    - Use `useScroll({ target: heroRef, offset: ["start start", "end start"] })` for hero-specific parallax
    - Transform: y moves up, opacity fades from 1 to 0 as user scrolls past hero

    **Section 2 - Philosophy Preview (100vh, bg-sand-50):**
    - Left-aligned large serif text taking 60% width on desktop
    - Quote-style: "For those who shape the future, privacy is not a feature -- it is sovereignty."
    - Font: font-serif text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl leading-relaxed text-olive-800
    - Small attribution line below: "The Elan Philosophy" in text-xs tracking-widest uppercase text-sand-400
    - Parallax: text slides in slightly from below as section enters viewport
    - CTA at bottom: "Explore Our Philosophy" link to /philosophy in understated style
    - Use ScrollReveal for entrance animation

    **Section 3 - Three Pillars (min-h-screen, bg-white):**
    - Three editorial blocks presented vertically (NOT a grid of cards)
    - Each pillar is a large text block with generous spacing between them:
      1. "Emotional Intelligence" -- "We understand that wealth is emotional. Every journey begins with understanding what moves you."
      2. "Privacy Sovereignty" -- "Your data. Your rules. Every interaction is governed by your consent, visible only to those you choose."
      3. "Narrative Experience" -- "Life is not a dashboard. We craft experiences that read like chapters of your personal narrative."
    - Each pillar: font-serif heading (text-2xl md:text-3xl text-rose-900) + font-sans body (text-lg text-olive-600)
    - Staggered ScrollReveal entrance (delay 0, 0.15, 0.3)
    - Generous vertical spacing between pillars (py-16 md:py-24)
    - Subtle decorative element: thin horizontal line in sand-200 between pillars

    **Section 4 - Visual Break (60vh, bg-rose-950):**
    - Dark cinematic section for contrast
    - Single centered statement in white/rose-100: "By invitation only" in font-serif text-4xl md:text-6xl
    - Subtext: "A membership as exclusive as the experiences we curate" in font-sans text-base text-rose-300
    - Parallax on the text (slower scroll rate)
    - This section creates visual drama and reinforces exclusivity

    **Section 5 - The Experience (min-h-screen, bg-sand-50):**
    - Editorial description of what members experience
    - Two-column layout on desktop (text left, decorative color block right)
    - Left column content:
      - Eyebrow: "THE EXPERIENCE" in text-xs tracking-widest text-sand-400
      - Heading: "Intelligence, Not Information" in font-serif text-3xl md:text-4xl text-rose-900
      - Body paragraphs (2-3) describing the platform experience in narrative prose:
        - "Elan Glimmora transforms how the world's most discerning individuals navigate their extraordinary lives."
        - "Through emotional intelligence algorithms and sovereign privacy architecture, we curate journeys that align with your deepest values -- not just your calendar."
        - "Every interaction is designed as a narrative moment, because your life deserves to be experienced, not managed."
    - Right column: Large abstract color block placeholder (bg-gradient from teal-100 to olive-100, rounded-2xl, aspect-[3/4])
    - ScrollReveal entrance for both columns

    **Section 6 - CTA (80vh, bg-white):**
    - Centered final call to action
    - Small text above: "READY?" in text-xs tracking-[0.5em] text-sand-400
    - Main heading: "Begin Your Sovereign Journey" in font-serif text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl text-rose-900
    - Brief text: "Enter your invitation code to experience Elan Glimmora." in font-sans text-lg text-sand-600
    - CTA button: "Request Access" linking to /invite
      - Use Button component, large size, bg-rose-900 text-white hover:bg-rose-800
      - Generous padding, subtle shadow
    - ScrollReveal for entrance

    **TECHNICAL NOTES:**
    - Use `useRef` for each section that needs custom parallax
    - Use `useScroll({ target: ref, offset: [...] })` for section-specific scroll tracking
    - Only use GPU-accelerated properties (transform: y, opacity, scale) -- NEVER animate top/left/width/height
    - Wrap in `useReducedMotion` checks -- if reduced motion preferred, render without animations
    - Responsive: All sections must work on mobile (stack columns, reduce font sizes, adjust spacing)
    - NO images -- use color blocks, gradients, and typography as visual elements until real photography is available

    src/app/(marketing)/privacy/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Create two editorial content pages that establish Elan Glimmora's brand identity and trust.

    **Philosophy page (/philosophy):**

    1. Server component with 'use client' wrapper only if animations needed (prefer server for SEO)
    2. Actually make it 'use client' since we want ScrollReveal animations
    3. Export metadata: `{ title: 'Philosophy' }`

    **Page structure:**
    - Hero section (60vh):
      - Centered, bg-sand-50
      - Eyebrow: "OUR PHILOSOPHY" in font-sans text-xs tracking-[0.3em] text-sand-400 uppercase
      - Main heading: "Intelligence, Not Information" in font-serif text-5xl md:text-6xl text-rose-900
      - Subheading: "A different way of thinking about wealth, experience, and sovereignty" in font-sans text-lg text-olive-600
      - ScrollReveal fadeUp entrance

    - Content section 1 - The Problem (min-h-[50vh], bg-white):
      - Narrow content column (max-w-2xl mx-auto px-6)
      - Heading: "The Paradox of Abundance" in font-serif text-3xl text-rose-900
      - 2-3 paragraphs of editorial prose about how UHNI are over-served with information but under-served with intelligence:
        - "Ultra high net worth individuals have access to everything -- except clarity. The more resources available, the more noise obscures what truly matters."
        - "Traditional wealth management platforms treat life as a spreadsheet. We believe it is a narrative -- one that deserves emotional intelligence, not just data intelligence."
      - Font: font-sans text-lg leading-relaxed text-olive-700

    - Content section 2 - Our Approach (min-h-[50vh], bg-sand-50):
      - Narrow content column
      - Heading: "Emotional Architecture" in font-serif text-3xl text-rose-900
      - 2-3 paragraphs about emotional intelligence approach:
        - "Every interaction with Elan Glimmora begins with understanding -- not your assets, but your aspirations. Not your schedule, but your soul."
        - "We call this Emotional Architecture: the art of designing experiences that align with your deepest values, respect your sovereignty, and evolve with your journey."
      - Decorative element: thin rose-200 horizontal line

    - Content section 3 - Sovereignty (min-h-[50vh], bg-white):
      - Narrow content column
      - Heading: "Sovereignty as a Right" in font-serif text-3xl text-rose-900
      - 2-3 paragraphs about privacy and control:
        - "In a world where data is the new currency, we believe your data belongs to you -- absolutely and without compromise."
        - "Elan Glimmora is built on the principle that privacy is not a feature to be toggled. It is a right to be honored. Every piece of information you share is governed by your explicit consent."
      - CTA link to Privacy Charter: "Read Our Privacy Charter" -> /privacy

    - All content sections use ScrollReveal with fadeUp variant and staggered delays
    - Generous vertical spacing (py-20 md:py-32) between sections
    - Typography: editorial long-form style, not bullet points or feature lists

    **Privacy Charter page (/privacy):**

    1. 'use client' for ScrollReveal animations
    2. Export metadata: `{ title: 'Privacy Charter' }`

    **Page structure:**
    - Hero section (60vh):
      - Centered, bg-rose-950 (dark, serious, trustworthy)
      - Eyebrow: "PRIVACY CHARTER" in font-sans text-xs tracking-[0.3em] text-rose-300 uppercase
      - Main heading: "Your Sovereignty, Our Promise" in font-serif text-5xl md:text-6xl text-white
      - Subheading: "How we protect what matters most -- your privacy" in font-sans text-lg text-rose-200
      - ScrollReveal fadeUp entrance

    - Preamble (bg-white):
      - Narrow content column (max-w-2xl mx-auto)
      - "This is not a legal document designed to obscure. This is a promise, written in plain language, about how we treat your information."
      - Font: font-serif text-xl leading-relaxed text-olive-700 italic

    - Charter principles (bg-white, continuous):
      Present 6 privacy principles in editorial format (NOT a numbered list or legal bullet points):

      1. **"Your Data Belongs to You"**
         - "Every piece of information you provide to Elan Glimmora remains your property. We are custodians, not owners."
      2. **"Consent is Explicit, Never Assumed"**
         - "We will never share, analyze, or process your data without your explicit, informed consent. No pre-checked boxes. No buried opt-outs."
      3. **"Visibility is Your Choice"**
         - "You decide who sees what. From your advisor to your spouse to your heir -- every data point has visibility controls that you govern."
      4. **"The Right to Disappear"**
         - "You can erase your entire presence from Elan Glimmora at any time. Global erase is permanent, complete, and immediate."
      5. **"No Surveillance, No Tracking"**
         - "We do not track your behavior for advertising. We do not sell your data. We do not build profiles for third parties."
      6. **"Security Without Compromise"**
         - "Multi-factor authentication, device recognition, and encrypted storage protect your information at every layer."

      Each principle:
      - Heading in font-serif text-2xl text-rose-900
      - Body in font-sans text-lg text-olive-700 leading-relaxed
      - Separated by generous whitespace (mb-16 md:mb-24)
      - Wrapped in ScrollReveal with staggered delays

    - Closing section (bg-sand-50, py-20):
      - Centered text: "Questions about our privacy practices?" in font-serif text-2xl text-rose-900
      - "Contact your dedicated advisor or reach out to our privacy team." in font-sans text-base text-olive-600
      - CTA: "Request Access" link to /invite

    **BOTH PAGES:**
    - Must feel like reading a luxury magazine article, not a website
    - Long-form editorial prose, NO bullet points or feature cards
    - Generous whitespace and typography hierarchy
    - ScrollReveal for section entrances
    - Fully responsive
    - Link back to homepage and to each other where natural
